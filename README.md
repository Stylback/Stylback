## About Me

Hi, I'm Jonas!

I'm a self-described generalizing specialist. I enjoy the process of learning new skills and have a tendency to dig deep into those I find particulaily interesting. Among these areas are medical technology, cybersecurity, server environments and the inner workings of consumer hardware.

Here on GitHub you can find some of my personal projects, both big and small. I believe in the active and open sharing of knowledge, as such I do my best to keep my projects well documented and with permissive licenses (when applicable) so that others can learn and build upon my work.

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch with me is via email, the address of which is listed on [my website](https://www.stylback.se/contact/).
